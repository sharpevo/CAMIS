      <P>
      <P><B>Requested file not found. The link you followed may be outdated or 
      inaccurate.</B></P>
      <P>This error may have one of several causes: </P><B>The address or file 
      no longer exists.</B>
      <UL>
        <LI>If you were trying to access a Web site, it may no longer be 
        available online, or it may have been moved to a different address. 
        <LI>If you were trying to play (or replay) a live broadcast, the 
        broadcast may have ended and the file for it is no longer available on 
        that Web site. If the broadcast was streamed from a particular Web site, 
        you can search that site for archived copies of the broadcast. Not all 
        sites archive their broadcasts, however. </LI></UL><B>The address was 
      entered incorrectly.</B>
      <P></P>
      <UL>
        <LI>If you typed (or pasted) an address in the RealPlayer Address bar, 
        be sure that you included the entire address. Double-check the spelling 
        and all capitalization within the address. Some servers are 
        case-sensitive and incorrect capitalization will prevent RealPlayer from 
        locating the file. </LI></UL><B>Your temporary folder is full or contains 
      a corrupt file.</B> 
      <UL>
        <LI>If the "Requested file not found" error is followed by an error with 
        the text "file:\\C:\WINDOWS\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE..." the 
        problem could be caused by a full or corrupt file within the Temporary 
        Internet Files folder. </LI></UL>To avoid this error, you can clear those 
      saved files: 
      <P></P>
      <OL>
        <LI>In RealPlayer, click <B>Tools</B>, then <B>Preferences</B>. 
        <LI>In the <B>Category</B> pane under <B>Connection</B>, click 
        <B>Internet / Privacy</B>.
        <LI>Click the <B>Change Settings</B> button. The <B>Internet 
        Properties</B> window opens.
        <LI>Click the <B>General</B> tab.
        <LI>In the <B>Temporary Internet</B> files area, click <B>Delete 
        Files</B>, and then click <B>OK</B>. It may take some time to delete all 
        the files.
        <LI>In the <B>History</B> area, click <B>Clear History</B>.
        <LI>Click <B>Yes</B> in the window that pops up. Again, it may take a 
        while to delete all the files.
        <LI>When this is completed, click <B>OK</B> and restart your system.
